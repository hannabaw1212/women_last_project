1,"Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by hypermobility of joints, skin that is easily bruised and hyper-elastic, and a tendency to develop scars easily. These disorders are caused by defects in the production or structure of collagen, a protein that provides strength and elasticity to various tissues in the body."
2,"The primary cause of EDS is genetic mutations that affect the production, processing, or structure of collagen. These mutations are typically inherited from one or both parents, and the inheritance pattern depends on the specific subtype of EDS. Some cases may result from spontaneous mutations, with no family history of the condition."
3,"There are 13 recognized subtypes of EDS, each with specific clinical features and genetic causes. The most common subtypes are the Classical, Hypermobility, and Vascular types. Other subtypes include the Kyphoscoliotic, Arthrochalasia, Dermatosparaxis, and Brittle Cornea types."
4,"The Hypermobility type of EDS (hEDS) is the most common subtype and is characterized by joint hypermobility, soft and smooth skin, and chronic pain. It is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but the specific genetic cause is unknown in many cases."
5,"There is no cure for EDS, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include physical therapy, pain management, and appropriate exercise. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to address joint dislocations, fractures, or other issues."
6,"Joint hypermobility can be managed through physical therapy, exercise, and the use of assistive devices such as braces or splints. A comprehensive approach that includes strengthening muscles, improving joint stability, and addressing pain is essential for managing joint hypermobility in EDS."
